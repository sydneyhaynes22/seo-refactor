            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    The dominance of mobile internet use 
                    means that users are searching for the
                    right business as they travel, shop, 
                    or sit on their couch at home.
                    Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
                    allows you to increase your visibility 
                    and find the right customers for your business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
                <p>
                    The web is full of opinions, and some 
                    of these can be negative. Social media 
                    allows anyone with an internet connection 
                    to say whatever they want about your business. 
                    Online Reputation Management gives you the 
                    control over what potential customers see when 
                    they search for your business.

                    Social media continues to have a sizable
                    influence on buying habits. Social media marketing 
                    helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, 
                    using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
