## Description
This project consisted of using an existing site given and refactoring it to improve accessibility. The purpose of this project was to learn the ins and outs of refactoring an existing site to make it more accessible and importance of doing so. In order to make the site more accessible semantic HTML was implemented, alternative text was added to images, links that weren't working were fixed and Meta and Title tags were also added in order to improve searches in the search engine. From this project I learned how to implement multiple semantic elements in HTML as well as accessibilty for users.
